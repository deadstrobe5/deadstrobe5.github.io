export const aboutMarkdown = `# Who Am I? ü§î

Just a guy who likes to build stuff and break things. I spend my days crafting software, making AI do my bidding, and diving into cybersecurity challenges. When the code's compiling, you'll find me climbing walls or hunting for dusty old books.

# What I Do üõ†Ô∏è

- Code stuff that actually works (most of the time)
- Break into things (ethically, of course) through CTFs
- Shamelessly automate my stuff with AI overlords so I can slack off while the silicon dudes do the heavy lifting
- Explore creative ways to earn money online and master the game of life

# Tech & Hacks ü§ñ

- **AI & LLMs**: Agents, LangChain, RAG, Vector DBs, AutoGen, Offline LLMs
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript, Rust, C++, SQL, Bash
- **Security**: CTFs, Pentesting, Cryptography, Binary Exploitation, Web security
- **Tools**: Cursor, Git, Docker, Linux, Burp, Wireshark

# When I'm Not Debugging üéØ

- **Bouldering**: Been climbing for 2 years, crushing V5s and eyeing those V6s
- **Books & Philosophy**: Collecting classics for under 5‚Ç¨ and dropping random Plato quotes at parties
- **Volunteering**: Spent several summers rebuilding homes in rural Portugal 
- **Gaming**: Where it all started - spent so much time gaming, figured I might as well learn to code
- **Crypto Gambling**: Throwing money at dog coins and hoping for financial freedom
- **Finding Nirvana**: Meditating my way to enlightenment or digging through mystic texts for illuminati secrets
- **Music**: Hardcore Radiohead fan when I'm feeling existential, deep house when I need to code in the zone
